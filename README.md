# My Pizza Calculator ⚡️

[mrcwbr.github.io/pizza-dough-calculator/](https://mrcwbr.github.io/pizza-dough-calculator/)

A simple pizza calculator built with [Qwik](https://qwik.dev), a new framework for building web applications.

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). The `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output during development.

```shell
npm start 
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.
